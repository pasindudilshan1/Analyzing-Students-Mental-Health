Primary language: Jupyter Notebook.

## Project goal

To explore and analyze factors related to students' mental health, visualize findings, and illustrate basic data science steps (data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and simple modeling where applicable).

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/pasindudilshan1/Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health.git
2. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended):
   python -m venv venv
